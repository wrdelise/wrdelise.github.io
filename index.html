                        My research interests are in meta ethics, applied ethics, the metaphysics of concepts and justification, and the philosophy of privacy broadly construed.

                        I hail from Concord, Massachusetts and did my undergraduate work at Dalhousie University and the University of King's College, in Halifax Nova Scotia. I graduated with a BA Honors in Philosophy and Classics.

                        Some projects I have under way are:

                            Contemporary accounts of the value of privacy in liberal democracies understand privacy as essentially related to autonomy (construed as an experience of authenticity). The class of experiences 'feeling private' and the class of factual states 'being private' are not identical. Examining this gap offers some insights into how we ought to assign our political capital when advocating for privacy rights.

                            Sometimes we object to overly demanding duties by saying ought implies can. Suppose I do not conceive that X exists, but after getting X I will come to believe that X>Y>Z. Meanwhile, I believe that Y is impossible to get. Suppose that were I to dispose to get Y despite this, I would get X by accident. If cases like this exist, then the application of the ought-implies-can objection is wrongheaded and has a suboptimal yield.

                            We suffer epistemic violence when hearers fail to have the relevant beliefs and dispositions to make sense of our language. At first look, we might want to categorically identify these hearers by the negative evaluative term 'ignorant' and seek to ameliorate the false beliefs or lack of true beliefs. But there might be hard cases, like differences in ontological commitments, or radical translation problems. These hard cases complicate accounts of epistemic violence because they make evaluating ameliorative duties characteristically fuzzy.

                            Metaphysicians are often at cross purposes when doing conceptual design, or even semantic ascension. For one, the priority of metaphysics and ethics is an open question. Also, metaphysicians are subject to committed ontological differences, normative differences, or teleological differences. In any case, we can lighten the load of these commitments by analyzing them into the clear language of normative reasons. Argumentation done in this fashion demonstrates stronger justification and is more communicable.

                        You can find my C.V. and contact information at the top right; I am always open for discussion, whether on these topics, or on most anything else.
