                        I haven't published anything yet! Once I do, I'll be sure to provide a copy here. Meanwhile, I am considering what to put on a substack: <a href="https://wrdelise.substack.com/">wrdelise.substack.com</a>.

                            Contemporary accounts of the value of privacy in liberal democracies understand privacy as essentially related to autonomy (construed as an experience of authenticity). The class of experiences 'feeling private' and the class of factual states 'being private' are not identical. Examining this gap offers some insights into how we ought to assign our political capital when advocating for privacy rights. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on this topic. The original has some serious flaws which are under revision, but can be found here: <a style="color: hotpink" href="dalhousie-thesis.pdf"><q>Paternalism and the False Assertion of Privacy.</q></a>

                        <li title="(One caveat is that at no significant point between disposing to get Y and obtaining X can the agent's beliefs about or dispositions toward X be updated)">
                            Sometimes we object to overly demanding duties by saying ought implies can (if we can't, then we oughtn't). Suppose I do not conceive that X exists, but after getting X I will come to believe that X>Y>Z. Meanwhile, I believe that Y is impossible to get. Suppose that were I to dispose to get Y despite this, I would get X by accident. If cases like this exist, then the application of the ought-implies-can objection can be wrongheaded.

                            We suffer epistemic violence when hearers fail to have the relevant beliefs and dispositions to make sense of our language. At first look, we might want to categorically identify these hearers by the negative evaluative term 'ignorant' and seek to ameliorate the false beliefs or lack of true beliefs. But there might be hard cases, like differences in ontological commitments, or radical translation problems. These hard cases complicate accounts of epistemic violence because they make our evaluations of ameliorative duties fuzzy.

                            Metaphysicians are often at cross purposes when doing conceptual design, or even semantic ascension. For one, the priority of metaphysics and ethics is an open question. Also, metaphysicians are subject to committed ontological differences, normative differences, or teleological differences. We can lighten the load of these commitments by analyzing them into the clear language of normative reasons. Argumentation done in this fashion demonstrates stronger justification and is more communicable. A first draft (which needs heavy revision or restructuring) can be found here: <a style="color: hotpink" href="writing-sample.pdf"><q>Reasoning About Commitments in Personal Identity.</q></a>

                        Before coming to philosophy, I spent some time researching the role of moral luck for evaluative ethnography in Ammianus Marcellinus' <i>Res Gestae</i>. <span title="my favorite instance of interlocked word order to date is Ovid Met. 1.533-34">I also have an enduring interest in the pragmatics of word pictures in Latin and Greek, both in prose and poetry</span>.
