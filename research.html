                    The foci of my research are in analytic philosophy. If broadly, philosophy asks the question <q title="W. Sellars, Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man" cite="https://www.ditext.com/sellars/psim.html">how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term,</q> then at first blush, I am interested in <i title="by reason, I mean a fact that explains or counts in favor of an option; by fact I mean a proposition or picture of the world; by option I mean an act, including the adoption of a belief">reasons</i> and their <i title="by communicability, I mean the ability of a reason to hold explanatory or normative value over the same kind of options between autonomous agents">communicability</i> between autonomous agents, and the structure of autonomous or heteronomous <i title="by concept, I mean the list of propositions that can be conceived of describing or failing to describe a term and its referent, and by revision I mean the change in the thing being tracked by the concept or the behaviors in response to use of the concept">conceptual revision.</i> I study the following disciplines in support of these questions.

                        Are theories of personal identity communicable between theorists with differing ontologies, and if they are not, how ought they become communicable?

                        What concept of the analytic-synthetic distinction survives Grice and Strawson's reply to Quine's infamous <i>Two Dogmas of Empiricism</i>?

                        If philosophers of privacy are right to give individuals rights because they are part of a group, does the individual obtain any duties toward those groups or their members?

                        Are we sometimes wrong to dispense moral or rational prescriptions because we have good reasons to think them impossible?

                        Can we change our concepts? If we can, should we? And when we do, is the change we are tracking a function of our meanings, or a function of our behaviors?

                    Much of my background is in Classics. My distinct interests are in the <span title="i.e., Ammianus ties the virtue of Julian to his behavior against the backdrop of fortune, in contrast to ethnographically evaluative language levied at the neighboring tribes, such as 'ira', 'rabies', fures'">ethnographical use of <i>Fortuna-Tyche</i> in Ammianus Marcellinus' <i>Res Gestae</i></span> and the <span title="e.g., anselm's ''... aliquid quo nihil maius cogitari possit' survived only so long as the quirks of Latin were permitted to fester, or the 'to gar auto noein estin te kai einai' of Parmenides.">implications of Greek and Latin semantics on the development of philosophical thought</span>.
